This little program is for my first try on CodeEva, the prompt is below:
https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/1/

Input sample: 
	Your program should accept a file as its first argument. The file contains multiple separated lines; each line contains 3 numbers that are space delimited. The first number is the first divider (X), the second number is the second divider (Y), and the third number is how far you should count (N). You may assume that the input file is formatted correctly and the numbers are valid positive integers.

Output sample:
	Print out the series 1 through N replacing numbers divisible by X with “F”, numbers divisible by Y with “B” and numbers divisible by both with “FB”. Since the input file contains multiple sets of values, your output should print out one line per set. Ensure that there are no trailing empty spaces in each line you print.
